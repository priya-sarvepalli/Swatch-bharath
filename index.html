Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, launched on 2nd October 2014 by the Government of India, is a nationwide cleanliness campaign with the objective of achieving cleanliness, proper waste management, and eliminating open defecation practices. It focuses on both rural and urban areas, emphasizing behavioral change and improved sanitation facilities. The campaign promotes the construction of toilets in households, schools, and public places to eradicate open defecation, while also working towards the eradication of manual scavenging and promoting dignity for sanitation workers. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan encourages proper waste management through practices like segregation, recycling, and composting, and promotes the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle) for effective waste management. It generates public awareness about cleanliness, hygiene, and the harmful effects of open defecation. The campaign aims to bring about a cultural shift and encourage cleanliness as a way of life, with active involvement of citizens, NGOs, and local communities in cleanliness drives. It also focuses on improving public sanitation facilities, especially for women and differently-abled individuals, and ensuring clean and hygienic sanitation facilities in schools. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan organizes cleanliness competitions to foster healthy competition among states and cities, and aims to reduce diseases caused by poor sanitation and improve overall public health. It has also created employment opportunities in the sanitation sector and received international recognition for its efforts towards cleanliness and sanitation. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is an ongoing mission, emphasizing stakeholder collaboration and behavior change communication, and its continued implementation is crucial for sustained cleanliness and sanitation progress in India..</p>

   <p>Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is such an initiative of the Central Government in which the contribution of all of us is very important. Every community consists of people of different religions, groups, castes, and other differences, but the cleanliness is valuable for all. The people in a community can together work for keeping their society neat and clean. It would be an inspiration for the other local communities.

Also, people in these communities can walk together to motivate others and teach them the value of cleanliness. A group of people will put a greater impact on people rather than an individual. The community can also gather a fund and arrange a campaign for other people. The community must be opened for other people to join.</p>
